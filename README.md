# Assignment 1
**Assignment and Code Blog entry due at 11:59pm on Monday, 4/12/2021**<br/>
**Demo due by 11:59pm on Monday 4/26/2021**

This assignment is intended to get you up and running with some of the tools we'll be using in this course and also to get you to start using HTML to create web pages.
## 2. Use Git and GitHub and start practicing HTML

The other tool we'll be using quite a bit for this course is Git/GitHub.  You're already here looking at this assignment, so we know you've got at least some Git/GitHub skills.  Practice a little more and also start using HTML by following these steps:

1. If you're new to Git and GitHub, take a few minutes to play with Git-it, which is a desktop app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub:

    We'll be using Git and GitHub heavily in this course, so it'll pay off to put in the time now to learn how to use them.
## Grading criteria

  * 40 points: Signed up for Campuswire
