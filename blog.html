        <h4>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h4>
        <p>One challenge I came to is using Git as I have only ever used it for looking at repositories and not really uploading any myself. Just going through Gitit and searching command usage really went a long way.</p>
        <h4>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h4>
        <p>I learned the basics of HTML and how to use Git. I knew a few about HTML basics but this helped solidify the usage.</p>
        <h4>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h4>
        <p>Watching the lectures and using Gitit really supported my challenges to be removed. Honestly felt really prepared.</p>

        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h4>
        <p>One challenge that I came across in this assignment is the attempt to visualize a lot of the CSS properties and comparing them to the mock. Overall, I just looked up properties and their values that could be modified.</p>
        <h4>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <p>I learned a lot of usage of CSS and how to modify properties in HTML to make it look visually pleasing to the eyes other than just basic markdown language</p>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h4>
        <p>Watching the lectures and using the MDN Web Docs really supported my challenges to be removed. Overall, really made me feel like I knew what I was doing for the most part.</p>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <p>One thing I had to google was the usage of flexboxes as the properties were a little confusing to me at the start but eventually got the hang of it.</p>

        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h4>
        <p>One challenging thing about this assignment is that it involved a totally new language to learn but I quickly learned the ropes as it seems to be a extremely simplistic languge.</p>
        <h4>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <p>Learning/Remembering JS was major part of this assignment as I havent touched it in years. From the basics of what most standard coding languages had it was fairly easy to pick up</p>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h4>
        <p>Again watching the lectures back again and looking through the supplied class readings and materials really helped me to understand it all.</p>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <p>How to store the twits off of the DOM and to put them back into it from searching.</p>
